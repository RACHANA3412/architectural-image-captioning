# Architectural Image Captioning

An AI-powered system that generates descriptive captions for architectural images using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model that can analyze architectural images and generate relevant, descriptive captions. The system is built using Python and leverages popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Preprocesses architectural images for model input
- **Caption Generation**: Generates descriptive captions for input images
- **Model Training**: Includes scripts for training the captioning model
- **Evaluation**: Tools to evaluate model performance

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/architectural-image-captioning.git
   cd architectural-image-captioning
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Training the model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Testing the model**:
   ```bash
   python test.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

## Project Structure
- `train.py`: Script for training the captioning model
- `test.py`: Script for testing the model on new images
- `dataset.py`: Data loading and preprocessing utilities
- `model/`: Directory containing model architecture and weights
- `dataset/`: Directory for storing training and validation data

## Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset of architectural images with corresponding captions. The dataset includes various architectural styles and building types.
